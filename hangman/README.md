## Hangman

A quickly whipped up implementation of hangman. If you're reading this, you're probably visiting from my GX talk. While you can of course take the code and run it however you like, the way I run it in my demo is using [this](https://www.online-python.com/) website.

Just create `main.py` and `hangman.py` files on this site, copy and paste the contents of this repository in the respective files, then run `main.go` (make sure you're not trying to run `hangman.py`).

I've tried to include a bit more in the way of explanations in here than in my demo.

`examples.py` has some examples of the basics of python. I'd recommend taking looks at pieces of it if you don't understand any of the code, and maybe copy and paste parts of it to run and see what it does.
